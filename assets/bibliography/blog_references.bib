  abstract={This paper investigates network information theory problems where the external noise is Gaussian distributed. In particular, the Gaussian broadcast channel with coherent fading and the Gaussian interference channel are considered. It is shown that in these problems, non-Gaussian code ensembles can achieve higher rates than the Gaussian ones. It is also shown that the strong Shamai-Laroia conjecture on the Gaussian ISI channel does not hold. In order to analyze non-Gaussian code ensembles over Gaussian networks, a geometrical tool using the Hermite polynomials is proposed. This tool provides a coordinate system to analyze a class of non-Gaussian input distributions that are invariant over Gaussian networks.},

    abstract ={This monograph develops unifying perspectives on the problem of identifying universal low-dimensional features from high-dimensional data for inference tasks in settings involving learning. For such problems, natural notions of universality are introduced, and a local equivalence among them is established. The analysis is naturally expressed via information geometry, which provides both conceptual and computational insights. The development reveals the complementary roles of the singular value decomposition, Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Rényi maximal correlation, the canonical correlation and principle component analyses of Hotelling and Pearson, Tishby’s information bottleneck, Wyner’s and Gács-Körner common information, Ky Fan k-norms, and Breiman and Friedman’s alternating conditional expectations algorithm. Among other uses, the framework facilitates understanding and optimizing aspects of learning systems, including multinomial logistic (softmax) regression and neural network architecture, matrix factorization methods for collaborative filtering and other applications, rank-constrained multivariate linear regression, and forms of semi-supervised learning.},
