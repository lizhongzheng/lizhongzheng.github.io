## The Key Points
The power of Neural Networks is largely derived from the ability to generate complex, non-linear functions for data processing. This marks a significant departure from classical model-based approaches, which often rely on linearity assumptions. Traditional tools such as the Fourier Transform, spectral methods, eigenfunctions, and least mean-square error (LMS) estimators lose their theoretical justification when linearity is removed. Interestingly, the challenge of designing non-linear processing is not new. Foundational work in this area includes Wiener's works on the [Volterra Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volterra_series) and multivariate orthogonal polynomials, which is now a largely overlooked literature known as [the Wiener G-Functional Expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_series), or the Wiener-Hermite Expansion. This page aims to provide a tutorial on these concepts in the context of modern machine learning applications. In particular, we will explore the connections between these classical techniques and the emerging field of Reservoir Computing, also with our own research on [H-Score Networks](https://lizhongzheng.github.io/blog/2024/H-Score/).
 

## What are Hermite Polynomials: Definitions and Notations

There are several versions of the [Hermite Polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials) defined in the literature. Unfortunately, we won't use any of them, but will define our own before making connections to the more widely used notations. 

To start, we denote $${\mathcal N}(x; \mu, \sigma^2)$$ as the Gaussian probability density function (pdf) with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ for variable $x$. We often call this distribution a **reference distribution**.

---
Definition: Hermite Polynomials
: For a given reference distribution as a Gaussian density function $${\mathcal N}(x; \mu, \sigma^2)$$, the Hermite polynomials are the sequence of polynomials $H_0, H_1, \ldots, H_k, \ldots$, where $H_k(\cdot; \mu, \sigma^2): \mathbb {R \longrightarrow R}$ is a $k$-degree polynomial, with parameter $\mu, \sigma^2$, and satisfy

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Hermite}
\langle H_i(\cdot;\mu, \sigma^2), H_j(\cdot; \mu, \sigma^2) \rangle \stackrel{\Delta}{=} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \; {\mathcal N} (x; \mu, \sigma^2) \cdot H_i(x; \mu, \sigma^2) \cdot H_j (x; \mu, \sigma^2) \; dx = \delta_{ij}
\end{equation}

---

**Remark: Standard Hermite Polynomial and Change of Parameter**

Hermite polynomials are defined with the parameter $\mu, \sigma^2$, i.e. the Normal distribution used to define the inner product. We can define the "standard" Hermite polynomial as $H_k(\cdot; 0, 1)$, i.e. defined with respect to the standard Normal distribution. Only for the standard polynomials we may drop the parameters for convenience to write $H_k(\cdot; 0, 1)$ as $H_k(x)$.

There is a simple conversion between Hermite polynomials with different parameters as follows.

---
Proposition: Change of Parameter
: For any $k, \mu, \sigma^2$ and any $x$,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:change_parameter}
H_k(x; \mu, \sigma^2) = H_k\left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}; 0, 1\right)
\end{equation}

---

{% details This can be verified with a simple change of variable.  %}

We only need to verify that with $s = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \int_{-\infty}^\infty {\mathcal N}(x; \mu, \sigma^2) \cdot H_i \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}; 0, 1\right) \cdot H_j \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}; 0, 1\right)\; dx\\\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty {\mathcal N}(s; 0, 1) \cdot H_i(s; 0,1) \cdot H_j(s; 0, 1) \; ds \\\\
&= \delta_{ij}
\end{align*}
$$
{% enddetails %}

**Remark: There is a slight difference between our definition and the ones commonly used in the literature.**

{% details Relation to the literature.%}

In the [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials), the "probabilist's Hermite polynomials" are defined as 

$$ He_n (x) = (-1)^n e^{\frac{x^2}{2}} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$$

which satisfy the orthogonality condition 

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty He_i(x)\cdot He_j(x) \cdot e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} \; dx = \sqrt{2\pi}\cdot  i! \cdot \delta_{ij}$$

These are nice because the resulting polynomials are *monic*, and because there is a nice recursion as 

$$He_{k+1} (x) = x \cdot He_k(x) - He_k'(x)$$

In our development, we do not care much about how to find the Hermite polynomials, or how complex are the coefficients. We thus choose a more convenient normalization  

$$H_k(x) \stackrel{\Delta}{=} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k!}} \cdot He_k(x)$$

so that all polynomials have unit power.

Finally, here are the first a few standard Hermite polynomials and a plot.
