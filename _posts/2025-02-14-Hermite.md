## The Key Points
The power of Neural Networks is largely derived from the ability to generate complex, non-linear functions for data processing. This marks a significant departure from classical model-based approaches, which often rely on linearity assumptions. Traditional tools such as the Fourier Transform, spectral methods, eigenfunctions, and least mean-square error (LMS) estimators lose their theoretical justification when linearity is removed. Interestingly, the challenge of designing non-linear processing is not new. Foundational work in this area includes Wiener's works on the [Volterra Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volterra_series) and multivariate orthogonal polynomials, which is now a largely overlooked literature known as [the Wiener G-Functional Expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_series), or the Wiener-Hermite Expansion. This page aims to provide a tutorial on these concepts in the context of modern machine learning applications. In particular, we will explore the connections between these classical techniques and the emerging field of Reservoir Computing, also with our own research on [H-Score Networks](https://lizhongzheng.github.io/blog/2024/H-Score/). 

There is a huge literature related to orthogonal polynomials, or more specifically to the Hermite polynomials. Some of the treatments can be quite elaborate, involving complex analysis and combinatorics. Some references are hard to find these days. We will also try to include some of the older papers or present the shortest proofs we know to some of the important classical facts.
 

## What are Hermite Polynomials: Definitions and Notations

There are several versions of the [Hermite Polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials) defined in the literature. Unfortunately, we won't use any of them, but will define our own before making connections to the more widely used notations. 

To start, we denote $${\mathcal N}(x; \mu, \sigma^2)$$ as the Gaussian probability density function (pdf) with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ for variable $x$. We often call this distribution a **reference distribution**.

Definition: Hermite Basis Functions
: For a given reference distribution as a Gaussian density function $${\mathcal N}(x; \mu, \sigma^2)$$, the Hermite polynomials are the sequence of polynomials $\phi_0, \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_k, \ldots$, where $\phi_k(\cdot; \mu, \sigma^2): \mathbb {R \longrightarrow R}$ is a $k$-degree polynomial, with parameter $\mu, \sigma^2$, and satisfy

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Hermite}
\langle \phi_i(\cdot;\mu, \sigma^2), \phi_j(\cdot; \mu, \sigma^2) \rangle \stackrel{\Delta}{=} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \; {\mathcal N} (x; \mu, \sigma^2) \cdot \phi_i(x; \mu, \sigma^2) \cdot \phi_j (x; \mu, \sigma^2) \; dx = \delta_{ij}
\end{equation}

---

**Remark: The Reference Distribution and Change of Parameter**

The Hermite basis functions are defined with the parameter $\mu, \sigma^2$, i.e. the Normal distribution used to define the inner product. We can define the "standard" Hermite basis functions as $\phi_k(\cdot; 0, 1)$, i.e. defined with respect to the standard Normal distribution. For the standard basis functions, we often drop the parameters and write $\phi_k(x)$ for convenience.  

There is a simple conversion between basis functions with different parameters as follows.


Proposition: Change of Parameter
: For any $k, \mu, \sigma^2$ and any $x$,

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:change_parameter}
\phi_k(x; \mu, \sigma^2) = \phi_k\left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}; 0, 1\right)
\end{equation}


{% details This can be verified with a simple change of variable.  %}

We only need to verify that with $s = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \int_{-\infty}^\infty {\mathcal N}(x; \mu, \sigma^2) \cdot \phi_i \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}; 0, 1\right) \cdot \phi_j \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}; 0, 1\right)\; dx\\\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty {\mathcal N}(s; 0, 1) \cdot \phi_i(s; 0,1) \cdot \phi_j(s; 0, 1) \; ds \\\\
&= \delta_{ij}
\end{align*}
$$
{% enddetails %}


**Remark: These basis functions are closely related to Hermite Polynomials.**

We deliberately use a slightly different notation and a different name to separate the basis functions from the existing terminology on Hermite polynomials. There are many nice properties the Hermite polynomials, but we will use only a few of them. For example, our discussion is generally known in the literature as the "Hermite Expansion", which starts with a key fact that the basis functions in our definition form a complete basis to all L2 functions <d-cite key="Davis2024HermiteExpansion"></d-cite>. It would be nice to see how our definition of the basis functions is related to Hermite polynomials. 


{% details Relation to the literature.%}

In the [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials), the "probabilist's Hermite polynomials" are defined as

$$ He_n (x) = (-1)^n e^{\frac{x^2}{2}} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$$

which satisfy the orthogonality condition

$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty He_i(x)\cdot He_j(x) \cdot e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} \; dx = \sqrt{2\pi}\cdot  i! \cdot \delta_{ij}$$

These are nice because the resulting polynomials are *monic*, and because there is a nice recursion as

$$He_{k+1} (x) = x \cdot He_k(x) - He_k'(x)$$

In our development, we do not care much about how to find the Hermite polynomials, or how complex are the coefficients. We thus choose a more convenient normalization

$$\phi_k(x) \stackrel{\Delta}{=} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k!}} \cdot He_k(x)$$

so that the basis function have unit energy.

Finally, here are the first a few standard Hermite polynomials and a plot.
